                <h2>Hello Everyone! ðŸ˜¸</h2>
                <p>
                    This website serves as an helpful guide for either new Baiken players, or for Baiken veterans that
                    want to up their game. <br>
                    Baiken has, even when she is kind of an unga bunga character, technical demands for her combos and setups.
                    That's why a lot of the setups and inputs are all written out very extensively. So that even a complete
                    beginner to fighting games can understand the stuff I'm talking about.<br>
                </p>

                <h2>Who wrote this?!?!</h2>
                <p>
                    This website has been written by NoRaven. <br> <br>
                    <span class="evilReset">Hello :D</span> <br>
                    <span class="evilReset">~NoRaven</span> <br><br>
                    A random guy from Switzerland that really really loves Baiken. For both her gameplay, her visual-design
                    and the depth she has as a character with all her setups, combo routes and oki options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing all the stuff down will take a pretty while so don't worry if your favorite thing or section
                    isn't yet finished/written. <br> <br>
                    Keep in mind that even with all the time I have on my hands at the moment it will take a lot of time
                    and effort for me to figure out how I can write stuff down so it actually makes sense to both me
                    and you, the reader of this website. <br>
