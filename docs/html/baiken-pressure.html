            <h2>PRESSURE</h2>
            <p>
                Pressure... oh my beloved pressure hue hue hue :3 <br>
                Baiken's pressure has a lot of depth to it, this mostly comes from her many many mixup and strike/throw
                options.
                <br>
                There are a lot of layers to her pressure so it's best to figure out your <a
                    href="./baiken-gameplan.html">gameplan</a>
                to get an idea on what she wants to achieve through her pressure. <br><br>
                For beginners, I can mostly say to not worry too much about opening up your opponent as they WILL fuck
                up and in
                the meantime you built up so much tension and RISC that they will explode on your next hit. <br>
                Make sure to occasionally sneak in a throw or two to make your opponent engage and challange into your
                pressure.
                <br><br>
                Some general tips for pressure: <br>
                - You always want to mix up your pressure! <br>
                - Don't be predictable! <br>
                - Be unpredictable! <br>
                - Mental-Stack your opponent to mental-retardness! <br>
                - Make your opponent wish they never picked up guilt gear!

            <h2>Stagger Pressure</h2>
            <p>
                What is Stagger Pressure? <br>
                You know how you can gatling your buttons into eachother? <br>
                Yeah, basically you don't want to do that xD <br>
                With that I mean you don't want to delay your gatlings... no no no, that is gatling pressure. I want you
                to just press <span class="slash">f.S</span> > <span class="slash">f.S</span> or something like
                <span class="slash">c.S</span> > <span class="punch">5P</span>, <span class="slash">c.S</span> > <span
                    class="kick">5K</span>,
                <span class="punch">5P</span> > <span class="punch">5P</span> > <span class="kick">5K</span> > <span
                    class="kick">6K</span> or
                maybe just your standard <span class="slash">c.S</span> run up <span class="slash">c.S</span>. <br><br>
                Okay but what does stagger pressure actually do? <br>
                Stagger pressure extends your pressure or if you want... blockstring for the duration that your opponent
                doesn't
                challange you, since... you know... there are BIG gaps in stagger pressure. Stagger pressure is needed
                when you see your
                opponent just holding down back and blocking everything, you want to make them try to take their turn
                back! <br><br>
                Can't my opponent just mash then? <br>
                Yes! <br>
                Your opponent theoretically could just mash on all your stagger pressure and if you see your opponent
                not respecting any of
                your blockstrings you definitly shouldn't go for stagger pressure as you'll just get counterhit over and
                over again.
                <br>
                If your opponent is just mindlessly mashing you should go straight back to gatling pressure with your
                delayed gatlings
                to frametrap them and catch their mash attempts. <br><br>
                As advice from me I'd tell you to use stagger pressure together with strike/throw and your <span
                    class="slash">f.S</span>
                is in my oppinion your best stagger tool. <br>
                Let's quickly go over it...
            </p>
            <div class="textspacer"></div>
            <h2><span class="slash">f.S</span> Stagger and why it's goated üêê</h2>
            <p>
                Baiken <span class="slash">f.S</span> is in my opinion THE stagger tool for Baiken. <br>
                It has: <br>
                - Great Gatling options: <span class="heavyslash">5H</span> and <span class="heavyslash">2H</span> <br>
                <span class="indent">-> to make your opponent respect you after it</span> <br>
                - Great Special Options: <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> and <span
                    class="slash">S-Kabari</span> <br>
                <span class="indent">-> <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span> especially since people like to block after <span
                        class="slash">f.S</span></span> <br>
                - Great Mixup Options: TK <span class="slash">Youzansen</span>, <span class="heavyslash">2H</span> and
                <span class="dust">Throw</span>
                <br>
                <span class="indent">-> People really really love to hold down back after <span class="slash">f.S</span> which enables run-up
                <span class="dust">Throw</span> and a cheeky TK <span class="slash">Youzansen</span></span> <br><br>
                Your main goal with <span class="slash">f.S</span> stagger is to either make them block <span
                    class="slash">S-Kabari</span>
                or to hit into your <span class="heavyslash">2H</span> or <span class="heavyslash">5H</span> which then
                lets you blow them up. <br>
                Another good thing about <span class="slash">f.S</span> stagger is that it puts a HUUUUUUGE load of
                mental-stack on your opponent.
                Because after <span class="slash">f.S</span> he has to worry about your gatlings, your special cancels,
                your mixups and the option
                you could do the silly thing to just go for yet another <span class="slash">f.S</span> üòä
            </p>
            <div class="textspacer"></div>
            <h2>Other Stagger Options that are helpful</h2>
            <p>
                As I already said before: Stagger together with tick-throws and general strike/throw is veeeeeeeery good
                since Baiken's
                throw game is just... well... pretty good üòà <br><br>
                After <span class="slash">c.S</span> microdash and either <span class="punch">5P</span> or <span
                    class="kick">2K</span> to
                setup a tick-throw which somewhat forces your opponent to show an option which in return lets you
                counterhit them.
                <br>
                Basically it's RPS

            <h2><span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> Pressure</h2>
            <p>
                Baiken has multiple very strong tools for her offense and probably her best one is <span
                    class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span>.
                <br>
                <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> serves as a: <br>
                - Frametrap <br>
                - Conditioning tool <br>
                - Tick throw setup (if near enough) <br>
                - Enemy downloader (I will explain what I mean by that) <br><br>
                What does bro mean by that? üò≠
            </p>
            <div class="textspacer"></div>
            <h2>Frametrap with <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span></h2>
            <p>
                Baiken in general wants to hit that juicy <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> ender since she gets
                so much from it. <br>
                But what she gets from <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> is written in <a
                    href="./baiken-oki.html">Okizeme</a>.
                <br><br>
                After basically any button Baiken can Frametrap with <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> to
                threaten
                either very strong Okizeme or a reset for a <span class="dust">throw</span> or a run-up <span
                    class="slash">c.S</span>.
                <br>
                Baiken's most common buttons that go into <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> are: <br>
                - <span class="heavyslash">5H</span> <br>
                <span class="indent">-> Sometimes true strings when close enough</span> <br>
                - <span class="heavyslash">2H</span> <br>
                - <span class="slash">f.S</span> <br>
                - <span class="slash">2S</span> <br>
                - <span class="dust">2D</span> <br><br>
                The threat of <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> after all those buttons makes your opponent
                scared
                to press or jump-out after which in return let's you get away with fake shit like <span class="slash">S-kabari</span>
                or even a run-up <span class="dust">throw</span> (Mostly after <span class="slash">2S</span> or <span
                    class="slash">f.S</span>).
            </p>

            <div class="textspacer"></div>
            <h2>The Infamous <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> RPS</h2>
            <p>
                What happens if my opponent happens to block <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span>? <br>
                That means you've finally made it! You and your opponent entered Baiken's domain... T H E <span
                    class="heavyslash">H - K A B A R I</span> R P S.
            </p>

            <div class="textspacer"></div>
            <h2><span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> Tick-Throws</h2>
            <p>
                It's a gimmick. <br>
                <span class="smol">And technically not tick-throw üòå</span> <br>
                Yes you read correctly, sadly it's a gimmick. If your opponent knows the matchup he will grab the living
                hell out of you. <br>
                Well... that is if you misspace it üòà <br> <br>
                There are certain spacings where the pull from <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> pulls your
                opponent close
                enough to you that you can threaten a microdash <span class="dust">throw</span> and a lot of people,
                even higher
                level players aren't used to that spacing so they will either mash throw which will whiff since Baiken
                is
                just a tiny bit too far away, or they will mash a button which is only a threat if they mash something
                fast
                like a <span class="punch">5P</span> or <span class="punch">2P</span> which will catch your tick-throw
                attempt.
                <br> <br>
                Buttons and strings that normalize this spacing in a way are: <br>
                - deep <span class="slash">f.S</span> <br>
                - far <span class="slash">c.S</span> <br>
                - <span class="slash">c.S</span> > <span class="slash">f.S</span> <br>
                - <span class="slash">c.S</span> > <span class="heavyslash">2H</span> <br>
                - <span class="slash">c.S</span> > <span class="heavyslash">5H</span> <br> <br>
                I would advise to hop into the lab and play around with the spacing, you have to get used to it. After a
                while
                you'll easily be able to tell when a button would set you up for a "<span
                    class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> tick-throw".
