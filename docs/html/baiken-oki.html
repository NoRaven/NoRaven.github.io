      <p>Normally if you jump and input <span class="slash">Youzansen</span> you wouldn't hit your opponent on their wakeup.
        <br>
        That's why you have to Superjump (Quickly press down and then up) to get enough height. <br>

        If you then delay your <span class="slash">Youzansen</span> Input you can hit your opponent meaty and even be
        plus on block. <br><br>
        There are two Variations for this setup. <br>
        Either you superjump with 9 (Up-Forward) to Crossup immedietly and the <span class="slash">Youzansen</span> hits
        normally, like in the sameside clip. <br><span class="cursive">This is the one used in this clip.</span> <br>
        Or you can superjump with 8 (Up), which is a bit harder for pad and stick players as you could hit 7 or 9.
        But it lets you choose which side you want to hit on the fly (making it less reactable).<br>
        <span class="cursive">will be covered later in the advanced section</span><br>
        For beginners, it's advised to first learn the following setup:</p>

        <h3><span class="slash">Youzansen</span> Crossup / Sameside Overhead Meaty</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        This time I will cover the more advanded and better setup for both the crossup and sameside
        <span class="slash">Youzansen</span>.
        <br> <br>
        Now instead of superjumping with 7 or 9 you are going to jump with 8 and 8 only. (That's up with no horizontal input)
        <br>
        And you also won't hit <span class="punch">j.P</span> twice as this would make it easier to spot the setup for your opponent.
        <br> <br>
        With this method, similar to the "Meaty <span class="slash">c.S</span>" setups,
        your timing on the <span class="slash">Youzansen</span> input will declare whether you crossup or hit sameside.
        What's also pretty cool about this setup is that the <span class="slash">Youzansen</span> input will be the same.
        This means you won't have to change input direction. <br>
        Another good thing about this setup is that the crossup <span class="slash">Youzansen</span> will be even more plus on block.
        Because it hits very late into its active frames. <br><br>
        Use this setup once you feel like you, firstly, have the timing down for the <span class="slash">Youzansen</span>.
        <br>
        You can also fall back to framekill with double <span class="punch">j.P</span> but that will make the setup easier to spot.
        <br><br>
        Note that after <span class="slash">Youzansen</span> is blocked you can sometimes be close enough
        to be <span class="dust">Thrown</span>.
        And to counterhit the throw you have to press <span class="punch">5P</span> or
        TK <span class="slash">Youzansen</span>. <br>
        Sometimes you are plus enough to get a <span class="kick">5K</span> or <span class="kick">2K</span> to counter,
        but it's advised to just <span class="punch">5P</span>.
        when you believe they want to throw.

      <h2><span class="slash">S-KABARI</span> MEATYS</h2>
      <p>
       As you already know, Baikens tether mechanic is something VERY powerful. Which means we want to basically always
        apply it (If that suits your playstyle of course...).<br><br>
        It would be pretty cool if we could sort of force our opponent to either block or get hit by
        <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span> on their wakeup, wouldn't it?<br><br>
        Well, it seems like we are lucky! <br>
        There are a bunch of setups or rather "routes" to get a knockdown which gives us a <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span>
        meaty.<br>

      </div>
      <p>
        One such knockdown route would be anything into an <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari~H</span> knockdown near the corner.<br>
        After you knocked them down with you <span>H-Kabari</span> followup near the corner, you have to OTG them with
        <span class="heavyslash">2H</span> and immedietly special-cancel into <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span>.
        <br><br>
        If you don't get a knockdown near the corner, the <span class="heavyslash">2H</span> OTG will either not hit or
        tumble them too far away for your <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span>

        From your normal BnB or other Tatami juggles you can route into <span class="kick">5K</span> Dash Cancel Kara
        <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> and not do the followup. <br>
        This will pull your opponent close enough for you to connect <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span>
        after they tumble away from you. <br> <br>
        Note that this is also a fake meaty setup and can be <span class="punch">6P</span>ed. The setup works perfectly against
        DP mashers or people who like to YRC as those will guarantee a <span class="heavyslash">6H</span> countehit.

        You already know what's going to happen... <br><br>
        SOMEONE IS GETTING MIXED!!!! <br><br>
        In this section of Okizeme we will talk about resets to get some cheeky mixups and setups. <br> br
        What is a reset? <br>
        A reset is performed when you purposefully drop your combo or even your blockstring early to
        "reset" the situation. <br>
      </p>

        <h3><span class="slash">S-Kabari</span> Resets</h3>
      </div>
      <p>
        There are multiple ways Baiken can reset, more like drop, her combo to get a cheeky left / right mix
        when you expect it the least. <br><br>
        One way Baiken can do this is from CH <span class="slash">c.S</span>.

      <p>
        Based on how much you delay your IAD you might hit them same side as you will be too low. <br>
        This one would be a so called "Collision Box" Mixup. <br><br>
