        <h2 class="article-subtitle">OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>Baiken is a versatile, aggressive samurai wielding a deadly blade that allows her to switch seamlessly between
          oppressive mid-range pokes and terrifying close-range mix-ups. The Unfaltering Samurai has returned, as formidable as ever.
          <br><br>
          With her well-balanced kit, Baiken fights effectively at a variety of ranges. She has many strong, mid ranged
          pokes, allowing her to bully opponents from afar. Up close, her IAS <span class="slash">Youzansen</span> and many frame traps give her
          strong mix-ups, and rewarding combos. <span class="kick">Tatami Gaeshi</span> is a veritable Swiss army knife of a move, supplying
          frame traps, combos, and safe blockstrings enders on the ground; in the air, it provides excellent space control
          and easy safe jump setups after most knockdowns.
          <br><br>
          Thanks to her parry, <span class="punch">Hiiragi</span>, Baiken's defense is entirely unique. It has a tight timing window and cannot
          deflect projectiles or throws, but comes out on frame 1, allowing Baiken to punish strikes heavily. This technique
          also doubles as a <span class="punch">Guard Cancel</span> with a unique sound and visual effect.
          Said <span class="punch">Guard Cancel</span> lacks the damage part, but
          allows Baiken to guard crush and dash cancel its recovery, turning the tables of the match at any given moment.
          The opponent must alter their timing constantly to lessen this risk - but by the same token, if Baiken becomes
          predictable in her parry attempts, she is ripe for punishment.
          <br><br>
          Baiken has the unique ability to tether herself to her opponent with a rope by landing a ground throw or <span class="slash">S Kabari</span>.
          Tethered combatants are pulled towards one another constantly, bouncing in if they move away or get knocked away
          from their tetheree. This allows Baiken to convert off of her pokes at long range into powerful combos, but if
          her foe catches her, she will pay the price.
          <br><br>
          The true strength of Baiken's sword only shows when the user takes calculated risks. Show courage, fight
          purposefully and master balancing risk and reward to make the target of Baiken's ire pay for their wickedness.

        <h2 class="article-subtitle">TETHER</h2>
        <p>Baiken's tether mechanic attaches her to the opponent, preventing either character from moving too far away
          from the other. This turns all situations with tether applied into very high-risk, high-reward scenarios for
          both sides, as the tether will allow for combo extensions that would otherwise be impossible. It also creates a
          variety of tricky movement options that can be accessed by trying to dash away from the opponent.
          <br><br>
          Baiken's tether makes all combos that land during its duration much more damaging, because attacks that would
          normally knock the target too far away to be followed up on instead cause them to rocket back in for another hit.
          Because this is a threat to Baiken as well, it's important that Baiken works to stay on the offensive whenever
          the tether is applied, and that she be familiar with the unique, more damaging combo routes available to her.
          <br><br>
          The tether also greatly increases the threat of Baiken's pokes. With tether applied, her buttons such as
          <span class="slash">f.S</span> and <span class="heavyslash">5H</span> are able to chain into Tatami Gaeshi
          for a full combo ending in wallbreak or <span class="heavyslash">H Kabari</span> knockdown.
          <br><br>
          For more information on tethered pokes, see <span class="link"><a href="./baiken-combos.html">Combos</a></span>.
          <br><br>
          Tethering does open up another extremely important option for Baiken: it gives her the threat of
          crossup <span class="slash">Youzansen</span>(j.<span class="slash">236S</span>). Most of the time an IAD into
          crossup <span class="slash">Youzansen</span> will whiff due to momentum and spacing, but with Tether you and your
          opponent will be pulled together, creating the threat of Baiken reseting / dropping her pressure / combo early to threaten a mixup.
          Tether gives Baiken huge mix and mental stack potential.
          <br><br>
          Do note that as fantastic as tether is for Baiken, The opponent can make use of it as well if they manage to
          escape Baiken's pressure.
          <br><br>
          Baiken can apply her tether through two methods.
        </p>
        <div class="textspacer"></div>
        <div class="article-title-div">
          <h3>KABARI</h3>
          <img src="../img/800px-GGST_Baiken_41236S.png" alt="Baiken S Kabari" class="article-image">
        </div>
        <p>
          <span class="slash">S Kabari</span> both applies the tether on block and on hit. However, almost no button
          combos into tether, either relying on a counter hit or very specific routing.
          <br><br>
          For routing see Tether routing in <span class="link"><a href="./baiken-combos.html">Combos</a></span>.
          <br><br>
          On Hit, Baiken is +6 and on block she is +3. This means its still her turn!
          For more infos for pressure after <span class="slash">S Kabari</span> go to <span class="link"><a href="./baiken-pressure.html">Pressure</a></span>.
          <br><br>
          If you succesfully tether your opponent, it's your game! And your game to win! As Baiken now has access to her best mixups,
          mental-stack and damage.
          <br><br>
          Sadly, <span class="slash">S Kabari</span> has a very big startup, 29f of startup to be precise, meaning... there is a BIG gap
          in your pressure. To make it even worse, it can be easily jumped, and realyibly 6P'd. ðŸ˜ž
          <br><br>
          Any good Baiken should learn how to succesfully hit / make your opponent block <span class="slash">S Kabari</span>.
          Either through good conditioning or cheeky resets.

        </div>
        <p>
          Your throw <span class="dust">4/6D</span> is THE best way to apply tether without a combo. <br><br>
          Why? <br><br>
          Because Baiken's post-throw pressure is GODLY. <br>
          Baiken has access to multiple mixups on her throw oki when tether is applied.
          She gets a left/right, a high/low, a safejump, a meaty, she can combo from throw... basically, she gets EVERYTHING.
          <br><br>
          I will go over them in depth in the "Throw Oki" Section in <a href="./baiken-combos.html">Combos</a>.
          <br><br>
          For now, all you need to know is that you WANT to throw your opponents.
