        <h1>NOTES FOR MYSELF</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>Applying <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span></h2>
            <p>
                I should be using a lot more stagger pressure. <br><br>
                For example, Shangbadung talked about pressing <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span> after a button that
                has
                a lot of cancel options afterwards. <br>
                He talked about that especially <span class="slash">f.S</span> and <span class="slash">2S</span> are
                good. <br>
                I should also only use <span class="heavyslash">2H</span> as a conditioning tool. <br><br>
                Good blockstrings to condition are: <br>
                <span class="slash">c.S</span> > <span class="slash">2S</span> >
                <span class="heavyslash">2H</span>/<span class="heavyslash">5H</span> > <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span>
                <br>
                And to stagger: <br>
                <span class="slash">f.S</span> > <span class="slash">f.S</span> > <span
                    class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> <br>
                Why? <br>
                with the <span class="slash">2S</span> I push my opponent far enough away so that there isn't a threat
                to myself
                after they block <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> <br><br>
                Generally I should be less scared to cancel into <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span> in their face.
                Since most
                of the time they don't expect it, or they are scared/conditioned to hold back down since they think a
                gattling
                or special cancel is coming. <br>
                On that note, I shouldn't represent <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span> too much as they will simply
                start to jump
                or counter me. <br>
                That's why Shang said I have to condition them to not try to jump/counter me with the following string:
                <br>
                <span class="slash">f.S</span> > <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> <br><br>
                Generally speaking, stagger pressure is very good for mental stack to make them think about too much so
                I can
                succsessfully apply my tether. <br>
                I should also use more <span class="dust">Throws</span>. And especially mix up my timing, occasionally
                shimmying
                or do another delayed button to keep them on their toes. <br>
                Another layer I should and HAVE to represent more is <span class="dust">BWA</span> as this will
                guarantee me a
                <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span>.
                <br><br>
                Cool Blockstrings that space me out safely if I know they want to press into my <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span>:
                <span class="slash">f.S</span> > <span class="heavyslash">2H</span> > <span
                    class="slash">S-Kabari</span>
                <br>
                <span class="slash">c.S</span> > <span class="slash">2S</span> > <span class="heavyslash">2H</span> >
                <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span>
                <br>
                Very close <span class="slash">c.S</span> > <span class="slash">2S</span> > <span
                    class="heavyslash">5H</span> > <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span>

            <h2>Stagger Pressure</h2>
            <p>
                I should be using a lot more stagger pressure. <br><br>
                What is stagger pressure? <br>
                Stagger pressure is basically when you don't force your turn to stop with a special-cancel. <br>
                For example, <span class="slash">f.S</span> > <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari~H</span> forces my turn
                to end.
                <br>
                But if I for example, do <span class="slash">f.S</span> into <span class="slash">f.S</span> I don't end
                my turn
                but rather I extend it to "mental-stack" or whatever you want to call it. <br>
                Stagger pressure is pretty good for Baiken actually, since she has a lot of Buttons that are safe (not
                punishable)
                on block and are either disjointed or have the threat of a mean special-cancel. This makes the enemy
                scared to press
                after a stagger, or how I should phrase it, a button that isn't special-canceled. <br><br>
                A way to condition my opponent is to use <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> after a button that I
                want
                to stagger with. <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> is like THE tool to make my opponent sit. <br><br>
                Another cool thing I should use more to stagger is <span class="punch">5P</span> > <span class="punch">5P</span>
                >
                <span class="kick">6K</span>. Since after <span class="kick">6K</span> the threat of the
                <span class="kick">Tatami</span> frametrap for a full Wallbreak combo is very high. <br>
                On this note... LEARN THE COMBO YOU BUM, DO IT RAVEN!!!!! RAHHHHHHH <br> <br>
                What just came to my mind: <br>
                After counterhit <span class="kick">Tatami</span>, does run up <span class="slash">c.S</span> dc
                <span class="slash">c.S</span> work? or do I have to <span class="kick">2K</span>/<span
                    class="kick">5K</span>
                after the dashcancel to get a combo? <br>
                It would be better if I could get a <span class="kick">5K</span> after a dashcancel since that would
                open up
                lots of wallcarry. <br>
                Route I'm thinking of right now: <br>
                ... > CH <span class="kick">Tatami</span> microdash <span class="slash">c.S</span> dc <span
                    class="kick">5K</span>
                jc <span class="slash">j.S</span> > <span class="dust">j.D</span> IAD <span class="punch">j.P</span>x? >
                <span class="slash">Youzansen</span> WS <span class="dust">j.D</span> WB (Optimal WB ender) <br><br>
                Alternively: <br>
                ... > CH <span class="kick">Tatami</span> microdash <span class="slash">c.S</span> dc <br> <br>
                Was fact checked: <br>
                ... > CH <span class="kick">Tatami</span> microdash <span class="slash">c.S</span> dc <span
                    class="slash">c.S</span> >
                <span class="kick">5K</span> jc <span class="dust">j.D</span> IAD <span class="punch">j.P</span>x2 >
                <span class="slash">Youzansen</span> WS > Optimal ender
                <br><br>
                ... > CH <span class="kick">Tatami</span> microdash <span class="slash">c.S</span> dc <span
                    class="slash">c.S</span> >
                <span class="kick">2K</span> > <span class="heavyslash">6H</span> > <span
                    class="heavyslash">H-Kabari~H</span>
                <br><br>
                ... > CH <span class="kick">Tatami</span> microdash <span class="slash">c.S</span> dc <span
                    class="slash">c.S</span> jc
                <span class="heavyslash">j.H</span> > <span class="kick">j.Tatami</span> >
                <span class="slash">c.S</span>/<span class="kick">5K</span> > <span class="heavyslash">6H</span> >
                <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari~H</span> <br>
                Mabye here we have to jc the first <span class="slash">c.S</span> beacuse of gravity scaling.
                <br><br>
                After the <span class="punch">5P</span> > <span class="punch">5P</span> > <span class="kick">6K</span>
                the enemy maybe wants to jump out of my pressure. This is because of the threat from the
                <span class="kick">Tatami</span> frametrap or a random <span class="slash">S-Kabari</span> or even a
                Tick-<span class="dust">Throw</span>. So I should also know a route for a random normalhit <span
                    class="kick">Tatami</span>. <br><br>
                Route on Dustloop: <br>
                ... > <span class="kick">Tatami</span> --> <br>
                ----> microdash <span class="slash">c.S</span> should most likely work which means we can go for the
                same
                route as before. <br>
                ----> <span class="kick">5K</span> jc <span class="slash">j.S</span> > <span class="dust">j.D</span> -->
                <br>
                extension should work as a consistent, staple route.

            <h2>Neutral (my behated)</h2>
            <p>
                In neutral, especially when approaching, I should stop overusing <span class="heavyslash">2H</span>.
                <br>
                While <span class="heavyslash">2H</span> is disjointed, low profiles, has kind of good reach... it is waaay
                too punishing when I whiff it, it's hella stubby. <br>
                Instead I should abuse <span class="slash">f.S</span>. It's fast, it's disjointed, and it has basically no
                recovery and actually pretty good reach. <br>
                Another button I should use more is <span class="slash">2S</span> as it's a pretty good one too. <br>
                It's very disjointed, very good reach, lingers.

            <p>
                After <span class="slash">j.S</span> dl <span class="slash">Youzansen</span> I should press
                <span class="slash">Slash</span> and if I get <span class="slash">c.S</span> I have to dashcancel
                it, press <span class="kick">2K</span> > <span class="kick">Tatami</span> > <span class="kick">5K</span>
                dc kara <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari~H</span> <br><br>
                After <span class="kick">Tatami</span> or <span class="heavyslash">H-Kabari</span> IABD <span
                    class="slash">j.S</span> can catch
                people approaching or pressing. For example a Ky doing <span class="kick">Stun Dipper</span> after <span
